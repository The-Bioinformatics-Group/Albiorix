<h1>History</h1>
<p>The computer cluster Albiorix was built in 2007, as an initiative to solve the problem with insufficient computer resources at the Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences (now BioEnv [http://bioenv.gu.se/english/?languageId=100001&disableRedirect=true&returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fbioenv.gu.se%2F], University of Gothenburg. Initially, the system ran phylogenetic inference analyses, but is nowadays also used for analysis of next generation sequencing data. In 2014, Albiorix received substantial support from the faculty of Science via the NOSI (http://bioenv.gu.se/english/research/research-resources/nosi) initiative, and was upgraded to version 3.1. Today (March 2015) there are 75 regular user accounts active, and 42 temporal accounts are available for MSc and PhD courses.</p>


<h2>Versions 1.0 (2007)</h2>
<p>8 CPU’s, 4Gb RAM, 250 Gb storage. 4 users.</p>

<h2>2.0 (2008)</h2>
<p>24 CPU’s, 14Gb RAM, 250 Gb storage. 4 users.</p>

<h2>3.0 (2010)</h2>
<p>72 CPU’s, 110Gb RAM, 5 Tb storage. 40 users.</p>

<h2>3.1 (2014)</h2>
<p>162 CPU’s, 650Gb RAM, 512 Gb storage. 75 users + 42 students.</p>


<h1>Community</h1>
<p>Albiorix has no formal management, but is instead govern by its community of users. You are free to use the system as you see best fit, but a few rules of conduct apply; If you need more hardware, then apply for more funding; If you need particular software installed, send Mats Töpel an email (administrator and benevolent dictator of the system); If you think we need better documentation, then update the manual and wiki or ask someone for help to do it. You can communicate with other in the community via the email group [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/albiorix].</p>

<h1>System</h1>
<p>The login node and compute nodes run CentOS with the Rocks Cluster suite (http://www.rocksclusters.org/wordpress/) on top. Occasionally, some nodes in the sandbox queue are installed with the Debian GNU/Linux operating system and used for special applications, test webservers and software development.</p>
