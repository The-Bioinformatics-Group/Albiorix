<h1>History</h1>
<p>The computer cluster Albiorix was built in 2007, as an initiative to solve the problem with insufficient computer resources at the Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences (now <a href="http://bioenv.gu.se/english/?languageId=100001&disableRedirect=true&returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fbioenv.gu.se%2F" target="_blank">BioEnv</a>), University of Gothenburg. Initially, the system ran phylogenetic inference analyses, but is nowadays also used for analysis of next generation sequencing data. In 2014, Albiorix received substantial support from the <a href="http://science.gu.se/english" target="_blank">Faculty of Science</a> via the <a href="http://bioenv.gu.se/english/research/research-resources/nosi" target="_blank">NOSI</a> initiative, and was upgraded to version 3.1. Today (March 2015) there are 75 regular user accounts active, and 42 temporal accounts are available for MSc and PhD courses.</p>


<h4>Version 1.0 (2007)</h4>
<p>8 CPU’s, 4 Gb RAM, 250 Gb storage. 4 users.</p>

<h4>2.0 (2008)</h4>
<p>24 CPU’s, 14 Gb RAM, 250 Gb storage. 4 users.</p>

<h4>3.0 (2010)</h4>
<p>72 CPU’s, 110 Gb RAM, 5 Tb storage. 40 users.</p>

<h4>3.1 (2014)</h4>
<p>162 CPU’s, 650 Gb RAM, 43 Tb storage. 75 users + 42 students.</p>


<h1>Community</h1>
<p>Albiorix has no formal management, but is instead govern by its community of users. You are free to use the system as you see best fit, but a few rules of conduct apply; If you need more hardware, then apply for more funding; If you need particular software installed, send Mats Töpel an email (administrator and benevolent dictator of the system); If you think we need better documentation, then update the manual and wiki or ask someone for help to do it. You can communicate with other in the community via the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/albiorix" target="_blank">email group.</a></p>

<h1>System</h1>
<p>The login node and compute nodes run CentOS with the <a href="http://www.rocksclusters.org/wordpress/" target="_blank">Rocks Cluster</a> suite on top. Occasionally, some nodes in the sandbox queue are installed with the <a href="https://www.debian.org/" target="_blank">Debian GNU/Linux</a> operating system and used for special applications, test webservers and for software development.</p>
